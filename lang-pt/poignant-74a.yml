        The foxes followed Blixy off behind the paint store and down the cracked, uneven asphalt.
        All of the stores on the dilapidated lane leaned at angles to each other.  In some places,
        slabs of sidewalk jutted up from the ground, forming a perilous walkway, a disorderly
        stack of ledges.  Almost as if the city planners had hoped to pay tribute to the techtonic
        plates.  One small drug store had slid below the surface, nearly out of eyesight.


        Truly, it was colorful, though.  The paint store had been tossing out old paints
        directly onto its neighbors.  The shops nearest the paint store were clogged with hundreds
        of colors, along the windowsills and in the rain gutters.  Yes, on the walls and pavement.


        Basically, beginning with the back porch of the paint store, the avenue erupted into a giant incongruous
        and poorly-dyed market.


        Further down, a dentist's office was primed with red paint and, over that, a fledgling artist
        had depicted a large baby who had fallen through a chimney and arrived in a fireplace full of soot.
        Crude black strokes marked the cloud of ashes raised during impact, easily mistaken for thick
        hair on the child's arms and back.  The child looked far too young to have much hair, but
        there they were: rich, blonde curls which toppled liberally from the child's head.  Under the child's
        legs was painted the word _BREWSTER_.


        The same artist had hit the library next store and had hastily slapped together a mural of
        a green sports car being pulled from the mud by a team of legless babies tugging with shiny chains.
        Again, the drastically blonde curls!


        "I need answers," said the Fox Tall, who had ground to a halt in front of the scenery.


        "I'm starting to believe there's no such thing," said Fox Small.  "Maybe these are the
        answers."


        "Brewster?" said Fox Tall.  He walked nearer to the library and touched the cheek of one
        of the legless children who was closer in perspective.  The child's cheek appeared to
        contain a myriad of jawbones.


        Blix was another two houses down, navigating through the askew brickwork, the paved gully that
        led to _R.K.'s Gorilla Mint_, as the metallic sticker on the door read.  The building was plastered
        with miniature logos for the variety of payment options and identification acceptable at
        _R.K.'s Gorilla Mint_.  Even the bars over the window were lined with insurance disclosures and
        security warnings and seals of government authorization, as well as addendums to all of these,
        carbon paper covering stickers covering torn posters and advertising.  And all mingled with
        paint splashes that intruded wherever they pleased.


        !i/wixl-9.gif(R.K.'s Gorilla Mint.)!


        "I like the way the fresh paper feels against my tongue," said the gorilla at the counter.
        His fingers rubbed quietly against the bills.  He drew his face near to the fanned currency
        and whisked his nose along the pulpy cash.


        "Is R.K. in this evening?" asked Blix.


        "R.K. is not," said the gorilla cashier.  He turned to the three travellers and spread
        his money out on the counter's surface, evenly spacing them apart and lining up all the
        edges neatly.  "Now, which one of these do you think is worth the most?"


        The foxes looked over the different bills and Fox Small muttered to himself, "Well,
        maybe-- no, but I'll bet-- Wait, does one of these have bananas on it?  'Cause that
        one-- nope, no fruit or rope swings or-- Terrible, this is difficult!"  And in a
        lower voice, "So difficult to read.  What does this one say?  Symbols or something?
        If all these bills have are symbols, it's going to be impossible for us to figure out
        which one is of the greatest value."


        "That's why I said, '_Guess_.'"  The gorilla tapped each bill in order.  "See, you've
        got a 1 in 5 chance."


        "Unless the symbols mean something," said Fox Tall.  "Unless we can figure it out."


        "We can figure it out," said Fox Small.


        "No," said the gorilla.  "The symbols are meaningless."


        "Whoever created the money intended some meaning for them," said Fox Small.  "Why
        use _this_ symbol?"  He pointed to an ampersand printed in dark ink.


        "Yeah, we saw you sniffing the money and fantasizing about it back there," said
        Fox Tall.  "I'll bet these symbols mean all kinds of things to you!"


        "No, I don't think so," said the gorilla.


        If I can weigh in at this point, I think the symbols do have meaning.  They may not
        be _loaded_ with meaning, it may not be oozing out through the cracks, but I'm sure
        there's a sliver of meaning.

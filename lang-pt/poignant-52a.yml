        No need for the animal's tickets to behave drastically different from the traditional
        tickets.  The @AnimalLottoTicket@ class is internally different, but exposes the same
        methods seen in the original @LotteryTicket@ class.
        The @score@ method is even identical to the @score@ method from the old @LotteryTicket@
        class.


        Instead of using a class variable to store the musical note list, they're stored in
        a constant called @AnimalLottoTicket::NOTES@.  Variables change and the note list
        shouldn't change.  Constants are designed to stay the same.  You can still change the
        constant, but you'll have to be tricky or Ruby will speak up.

        The gull came back with the grazledon, his name was Merphy, he was thrilled to play chance,
        he puffed his face dreamily, whistled five and six notes
        in series, they all held his collar, pulled him close to the calculator and let him breathe
        three notes, then they choked the bedosh outta him until his ticket was printed and 
        everything was nicely catalogued inside @@@tickets['merphy']@.  Thankyou, see ya at the draw!


        So, the fever of the lottery became an epidemic among the simple minds of the animals.  
        Paij-ree saved his costs, used the same @LotteryDraw@ class he'd used in the corporate environment of
        the lottery from his childhood.  And soon enough, the animals were making their own
        music and their own maps and films.


        "What about The Originals?" I asked Paij-ree.  "They must have hated your animals!"


        But he winced sourly and pinched his forehead.  "I am an Original.  You as well.
        Do we (ae-o) hate any of them?"


        Not too long after the lottery ended, Paij-ree felt the crater gull _Eb-F-F-A_
        lighting upon his shoulder, which whistled an urgent and sad _C-Eb-D C-A-Eb_.
        These desparate notes sent an organ roll of chills straight through Paij-ree.  Had the
        King God of Potted Soil, Our Beloved Topiary, *the Mossiah Quos*, Literal Father of
        That Man Who Would Be My Daughter's Organ Instructor -- had he truly come to his end?
        How could this be?  Could the great arbors no longer nourish him and guide the moist crosswinds
        to him?  Or did his own spindly lichen hedge up his way and grow against his breathing?


        _You never mind_, went the tune of the gull.  _He has detoriated and weakened and fallen in the
        lit door of your home cottage.  His tendrils needing and crying for the day to not end.
        For the sun to stay fixed and wide and attentive._


        Plor-ian, the house attendant, kept the pitchers coming and Quos stayed well watered
        until Paij-ree arrived to survey the decaying buds of soft plant and the emerging face of
        his father, the lottery captain.  His skin deeply pocked like an overly embroidered pillow.
        Great shoots springing from his sleeves now curled back with lurching thirst.


        Paij-ree combed back the longer stems around his father's eyes and those coming from the
        corners of his mouth.  While I'd like to tell you that Paij-ree's tears rolled down
        his sleeves and into the pours of his father, rejuvenating and restoring the grassy gentleman:
        I cannot say this.


        Rather, Paij-ree's tears rolled down his sleeves and into the creaking clapboard floor,
        nourishing the vile weeds, energizing the dark plant matter, which literally lept through
        the floor at night and strangled Our Quos.  Yank, pull, crack.  And that was his skull.


        So Paij-ree could never be called Wert-ree or Wert-plo after that.

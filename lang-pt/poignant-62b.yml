        You've learned so much about @OpenURI@ and using @yield@ to write your own iterators.
        You know your way around the lost-and-found service.  Really, you can starting hunting
        through the Wixl junk drawer without me.


        Let's neatly _encapsulate_ the entire service into a single class.

        
        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'
         module PreEventualist
           def self.open page, query
             qs = 
               query.map do |k, v|
                 URI.escape "#{ k }=#{ v }"
               end.join "&"
             URI.parse( "http://preeventualist.org/lost/" + page + "?" + qs ).open do |lost|
               lost.read.split( "--\n" )
             end
           end
           def self.search word
             open "search", "q" => word
           end
           def self.searchlost word
             open "searchlost", "q" => word
           end
           def self.searchfound word
             open "searchfound", "q" => word
           end
           def self.addfound your_name, item_lost, found_at, description
             open "addfound", "name" => your_name, "item" => item_lost, 
                              "at" => found_at, "desc" => description
           end
           def self.addlost your_name, item_found, last_seen, description
             open "addlost", "name" => your_name, "item" => item_found,
                             "seen" => last_seen, "desc" => description
           end
         end
        </pre>


        At some point with your code, you need to start shaping it into something neat.  Save the above
        module in a file called @preeventualist.rb@.


        This module is a very simple library for using the Preeventualist's service.  This is exactly the
        way libraries are written.  You whip up a module or a class, store it in a file, and, if you're
        happy with it and want the world to benefit, put it on the web.


        These stragglers can you use your module just like I used @OpenURI@ earlier.


        <pre>
         irb> require 'preeventualist'
         irb> puts PreEventualist.search( 'truck' )
         irb> puts PreEventualist.addfound( 'Why', 'Ruby skills', 'Wixl park',
                "I can give you Ruby skills!\nCome visit poignantguide.net!" )
        </pre>

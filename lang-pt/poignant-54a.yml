        But another shadow combined, narrow and determined.  Right behind her, the hand came
        on to her shoulder, and the warm ghost inside the hand touched her sleeve.


        "How did you get down here?" said the girl.


        Dr. Cham sat right alongside her and the goat walked around and stood in front.


        "Listen to us," said Dr. Cham.  "We've got to follow this mangy pack of ne'er-do-wells
        to the very end, Hannah.  And to nab them, we need your faithful assistance!"


        "I'm scared," cried Hannah.


        "You're not scared," said the goat.  "Come on.  You're a terrifying little phantom child."


        "Well," she said.  "I'm a little bored."


        Dr. Cham bent down on a knee, bringing his shaggy presence toward the ground, his face
        just inches from hers.  "If you come with us, if you can trust what we know, then we can bag
        this foul troupe.  Now, you say your destiny is to be a baker.  I won't dispute that.
        You have every right on Earth -- and Endertromb, for that matter -- to become a baker.
        Say, if you didn't become a baker, that would be a great tragedy.  Who's going to take
        care of all those donuts if you don't?" 


        She shrugged.  "That's what I've been saying."


        "You're right," said the Doctor.  "You've been saying it from the start."  He looked up to
        the sky, where the wind whistled peacefully despite its forceful piercing by The Originals'
        rocketship.  "If your destiny is to be a baker, then mine is to stop all this, to end the
        mayhem that is just beginning to boil.  And hear me, child -- hear how sure and solid my voice
        becomes when I say this -- I ended your life, I bear sole responsibility for your life as
        an apparition, but I will get it back.  It's going to take more than a donut, but you will
        have a real childhood.  I promise you."

        Sure, it took a minute for the goat to cut his wish down to ten letters, but he was shortly on
        his way, following the same jetstreams up into the sky, up toward Dr. Cham and his ghost
        niece Hannah.  Up toward the villanous animal combo pak called The Originals.  Up toward
        The Rockettes.


        And Digger Dosh bludgeoned and feasted on each second they left behind them.

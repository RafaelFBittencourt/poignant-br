        I think the Youth Study Clan is doing a great job with this service.  It's a little hokey and
        threadbare, but if it can get animals to stop using their instinctive means of declaring ownership,
        then hats off.


        Still, a preeventualist youth group?  How can that be?  You've got to at least _flirted with
        real cynicism_ before you can become a preeventualist.  And you definitely can't attend school.
        So, I don't know.


        Going back to the list of instructions from the Preeventualist's Losing and Finding Registry.


        <pre class="text">
         USING THE L&F SERVER
         ====================
         The L&F is a free service.  The acts of losing and finding are essential qualities in
         building a preeventualist lifestyle.  We hope to accomodate your belief.


         We do not use HTML, in order to simplify our work here.  Our guys are already working
         fifteen hour days.  (Thanks, Terk!!  Thanks, Horace!!)


         You may search our service for your lost items.  Or you may add your lost (or found)
         item to our registry.  This is done by typing the proper address into your browser.

         SEARCHING
         =========
         To search for lost items, use the following address:

           http://preeventualist.org/lost/search?q={search word}

         You may replace {search word} with your search term.  For example, to search for "cup":

           http://preeventualist.org/lost/search?q=cup

         You will be given a list of cups which have been lost or found.

         If you want to search for only lost cups or only found cups, use the `searchlost' and
         `searchfound' pages:

           http://preeventualist.org/lost/searchlost?q=cup
        </pre>


        I'm not playing games.  I know where the truck is.  Really, I'm not teasing you.  I'll 
        show you in just a sec.  I'm just saying, look at the foxes:


        !i/wixl-11.gif(Hummmmm.)!


        They are helpless.  And yet, here is this great tool.  A possible key to getting out of this mess.
        I just want to poke around, see if there are any clues here.


        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'
         
         # Searching all found items containing the word `truck'.
         open( "http://preeventualist.org/lost/searchfound?q=truck" ) do |truck|
           puts truck.read
         end
        </pre>


        I'm not seeing anything about the tall fox's truck in this list.  That's okay.
        The foxes are out of it anyway.  We have some time.


        You've learned a very simple technique for retrieving a web page from the Internet.  The code
        uses the @OpenURI@ library, which was written by one of my favorite Rubyists, Akira Tanaka.  He's
        simplified reading from the Internet so that it's identical to reading a file from your computer.


        In a previous chapter, we stored your diabolical ideas in a text file.  You read these files in Ruby
        using @open@.


        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'

         # Opening an idea file from a folder on your computer.
         open( "folder/idea-about-hiding-lettuce-in-the-church-chairs.txt" ) do |idea|
           puts idea.read
         end
        </pre>


        Files are *input-output objects*.  You can read and write to a file.  In Ruby, all IO (input-output)
        objects have @read@ and @write@ methods.  The @open@ method slides an IO object *down the chute*
        into a block for your use.  IO is your ticket to the outside world.  It's the rays of sunlight cast
        through the prison bars.  (However, you can't @write@ to a web page with @OpenURI@.  You'll need to find a
        tool for copying to your web server.  An FTP program, for instance.)


        If someone wants to read your diabolical idea about hiding lettuce in the church chairs, assuming
        you've posted it as a web page:


        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'

         # Opening an idea file available on a web site.
         open( "http://your.com/idea-about-hiding-lettuce-in-the-church-chairs.txt" ) do |idea|
           puts idea.read
         end
        </pre>


        The @OpenURI@ library also understands FTP addresses as well.  This widens the possibilities for
        where you can store files.  On your system or elsewhere on the Internet.


        h3. Reading Files Line by Line


        When you're using @OpenURI@ to get information from the web with the @open@ and @read@ methods,
        the page is given to you as a @String@.  You can also read the page one line at a time, if you're
        searching for something.  Or if the page is big and you want to conserve your computer's memory.


        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'
         open( "http://preeventualist.org/lost/searchfound?q=truck" ) do |truck|
           truck.each_line do |line|
             puts line if line['pickup']
           end
         end
        </pre>

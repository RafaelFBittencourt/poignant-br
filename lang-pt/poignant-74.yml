        "So what?  You don't think animals with tentacles can drive?"


        "Well, not only is he going to flub up the steering wheel but he has all these
        legs all over the foot pedals.  This is not smart.  Let's get another bus.  Come on."
        
        
        "You know, he's probably been driving like that all day.  Is he really going to
        start crashing at this point in his career?"
        

        "Buses do crash," said Fox Small.  "Some do.  This smells crashworthy."


        "Sheer doo-doo!"  And Fox Tall yelled to the driver, "Hey, cabby, how long
        have you been driving this bus for?"


        The bus driver peered over darkly under his cap and started to turn toward them, but his
        tentacles were stuck to the wheel.  He jerked swiftly at his forelegs and, failing their
        release, he turned to the wheel and focused his energies on milking his glands for some
        slicker secretions.  Bubbles of mucus oozed.


        "Let's get outta here," said Fox Tall and the two ran off into the street, slamming right
        into the cat Blix.


        "Alright, well, the bus is full," said Blix.  "I don't know why the driver stopped if he knew the
        bus was crammed with hoppers."


        "We're thinking he was about to crash into us," said Fox Tall, "and he opened the
        door to make it look like a planned route stop."


        "Keep in mind, Blix, we hadn't really discussed that possibility out loud, so I haven't had a chance
        to formally agree," said Fox Small.  "Nevertheless, it sounds rational to me."


        "I'm thinking all the buses are going to be full like this."  Blix bit his lip,
        thinking and flicking his eyes about.  "Let's just--"  He pointed down the circuitry
        of apartment buildings that wound to the south.  "But maybe--"  He looked up and surveyed the stars,
        scratching his head and counting the constellations with very small poking motions
        from the tip of his finger.


        "Are you getting our bearings from the stars and planets?" asked Fox Small.


        Blix didn't speak, he ducked off to the north through a poorly laid avenue
        back behind the paint store.
        But before we follow them down that service road, Smotchkkiss, I have one more
        frog for you, perched on a long lilypad that stretches out to hold anything at all.


        <pre>
         irb> cat = "Blix"
         irb> puts "Does #{ cat } see what's up?  Is #{ cat } aware??"
           => "Does Blix see what's up?  Is Blix aware??"
        </pre>


        The little frogs from earlier (@%s@ or @%d@) were only placeholders for
        single strings.  Saving places in the string.


        The lilypads above start with a flower bud, the *octothorpe*.  You've also
        seen it as a pound sign on telephones.  After the flower bud, two leaves
        form the edges of the lilypad.  The leaves are *curly braces*, also seen many
        times before as the _crab pincers_ for a code block.


        bq. An empty lilypad @"#{}"@ becomes an empty string @""@.


        When the lilypad is found in a *double-quoted* string, Ruby runs any code found in between
        the two leaves of the lilypad.  The lilypad is lifted out and the result of the code is placed there in
        the string.  This lilypad swap is called _string interpolation_.


        <pre>
         irb> fellows = ['Blix', 'Fox Tall', 'Fox Small']
         irb> puts "Let us follow #{ fellows.join ' and ' } on their journey."
           => "Let us follow Blix and Fox Tall and Fox Small on their journey."
        </pre>


        The lilypad is very durable and can hold any kind of code inside.  Above
        we are using @Array#join@, but you can do anything you like inside.  Call
        object methods, conditional @if@ or @case@ statements, even define classes.


        <pre>
         irb> blix_went = :north
         irb> puts "Blix didn't speak, he ducked off to the #{ blix_went } through #{
                     if blix_went == :north
                       'a poorly laid avenue behind the paint store'
                     elsif blix_went == :south
                       'the circuitry of apartment buildings'
                     else
                       '... well, who knows where he went.'
                     end }.  But before we follow them..."
         => "Blix didn't speak, he ducked off to the north through a poorly laid avenue
             behind the paint store.  But before we follow them..."
        </pre>

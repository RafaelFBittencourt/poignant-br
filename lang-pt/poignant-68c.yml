        You have four weapons.  The boomerang.  The hero's sword.  The lettuce.  And the bombs.


        To start off, open up @irb@ and load the libraries we've created above.


        <pre>
         irb> require 'dwemthy'
         irb> require 'rabbit'
        </pre>

         
        Now, unroll yourself.


        <pre>
         irb> r = Rabbit.new
         irb> r.life
           => 10
         irb> r.strength
           => 2
        </pre>


        Good, good.


        h3. Rabbit Fights ScubaArgentine!


        You cannot just go rushing into Dwemthy's Array, unseatbelted and merely
        perfumed!!  You must advance deliberately through the demonic cotillion.  Or south,
        through the thickets and labyrinth of coal.


        For now, let's lurk covertly through the milky residue alongside the aqueducts.  And 
        sneak up on the @ScubaArgentine@.


        <pre>
         class ScubaArgentine < Creature
           life 46
           strength 35
           charisma 91
           weapon 2
         end
        </pre>


        To get the fight started, make sure you've created one of you and one of the
        @ScubaArgentine@.


        <pre>
         irb> r = Rabbit.new
         irb> s = ScubaArgentine.new
        </pre>


        Now use the little boomerang!


        <pre>
         irb> r ^ s
         [You hit with 2 points of damage!]
         #<ScubaArgentine:0x808c864 @charisma=91, @strength=35, @life=44, @weapon=2>
         [Your enemy hit with 28 points of damage!]
         [Rabbit has died.]
        </pre>


        For crying out loud!!  Our sample rabbit died!!

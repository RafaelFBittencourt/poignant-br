      Steaks 'n' Slides: >

        My uncles love waterslides and they also love steakhouses.  They have these waterslide days
        which are directly followed by a trip over to Joey's Steakhouse.  I _hate_ Joey's Steakhouse.  It's
        all big, brown shoe meat.  Floppy and galoshy.  Mixed with the stench of the uncles' chlorine.


        Pruny fingers on meat slabs is The Revolting.


        It's time for steaks and waterslides to come together in a truly repugnant manner.
        My uncles have had steaks and waterslides their whole lives.  The dynasty of steaks
        and waterslides must come to a close.  I will marry them in ways against nature!


        Like this:


        * Hand steaks to riders as they board the waterslide.  Rider looks at the lifeguard.
        Lifeguard says wait.  Rider looks again.  The lifeguard pauses.  Then.  Okay, it's time.
        _Go, kid, go!_  And the look on that kid's face as he rushes down the slope, paws
        full of chuck!  _Go, kid, go!_

        * Kids slide on top of steaks.  For safety, we'd want the slides stacked five steaks deep.

        * Or, steaks do the sliding.  In their own little swim trunks.

        * Or, people.  With steak swim trunks.

        * People and steaks, side-by-side.
        
        * Steaks travelling down waterslides composed of steaks.

        * Steaks travelling down waterslides made of people.

        * And, of course, people eating steaks, but their tongues come out as waterslides and
        they have to push the steaks up the waterslides.  Which is impossible and a lifeguard has to climb
        up the waterslide and manually insert the steak into the esophagus.

        * Waterslides eating people and steaks eating people.

        * Waterslides and steaks becoming friends after smelling people on each other's breath.

        * Or, steaks befriending waterslides, but waterslides not reciprocating.  Waterslides
        become increasingly despondent and detached, getting into bad crowds and sinking into
        political extremity.  Steaks make ankle bracelets out of people and leave them in the
        waterslides' trouser pockets, when the trousers are unattended.  They sneak out of the
        waterslide commune via a huge waterslide made of steak swim trunks.

        * Or, like I said, people with steak swim trunks.
